# Tree project
Tree project for investigation of trees around Paris region. 

Inspired and started by students from Master Data Science course 2020 at CRI. Dana started the notebook, Liubov has started to look at the data. Liubov and Marc leading the course.

# Data 
The project is based on the data

# Methods 
We use network methods and general statistics for tree data analysis. 
The main types of algorithms applied here are: 
1. algorithm for construction of geometric graph out of N points in locations of trees 
2. algorithm for construction of happy walks on cities
